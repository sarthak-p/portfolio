Just graduated with a CS degree and 6+ years of programming under my belt, yet I've only just started coding. Yes, you read that right. Why? Because now, I code by my own rules, on my own terms.

During my academic years, I was constantly juggling assignments, projects, and deadlines. There was always a requirement to meet or a box to tick. It was all about getting through the curriculum. But now, without the looming pressure of grades or the strict structure of academia, I've found my coding nirvana.

Gone are the days of deadlines and assignments. The difference? There's no pressure. I'm not coding because I have to; I'm coding because I want to. It's no longer a task; it's a journey of discovery.

Each day offers something new to learn, a problem to solve, or an idea to explore. It's thrilling to envision something cool and have the skills to bring that vision to life, just the freedom to explore and create.

I code not for a paycheck, but for the sheer joy of creating something from nothing, and to be ready when inspiration strikes.

I code because it's my playground. Because it allows me to do what I love, and in doing so, I'm setting myself up for something greater. Not just as a developer, but as a creator, a thinker, and a dreamer.

This is why, after years of programming and a formal education in computer science, I've truly just started coding.
