Iâ€™d like to introduce one of our recent projects, Nearby, an app that Sai Patipati and I developed to connect users with historical facts around their locations. By integrating AI through the Gemini API with Swift and SwiftUI, it shows facts around you that you never knew. 

Building this app taught us a lot. No matter how simple or complex your idea is, bringing it to life is incredibly rewarding. Using AI, you can really take your ideas to new heights and solve real problems.

I encourage you to start your own projects, no matter how challenging they seem. Use AI to break new ground and create something great!
