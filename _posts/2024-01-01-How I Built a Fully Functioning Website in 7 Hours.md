title: "How I Built a Fully Functioning Website in 7 Hours"
---

After months of not writing a single line of code (yes, even coders need a break!), I decided to dive right back in. And guess what? I built a portfolio website from scratch in just 7 hours!

Why am I sharing this? Because I want to remind everyone, especially those new to the tech world or those feeling a bit rusty, that building projects is the golden key to learning and growing. It's not just about coding; it's about the entire journey - embracing every aspect of the Software Development Life Cycle. From brainstorming to that final moment of deployment, every step is a lesson in itself.

This small project was more than just a refresher. It was a full-on, hands-on crash course in planning, creating, testing, deploying, and yes, even a bit of cheating (we all know how it goes!). It's incredible how much you can learn (or relearn) by just getting your hands dirty with code.

It's so important to keep building. Not only does it sharpen your skills, but it also adds some sparkle to your portfolio - a surefire way to catch the eyes of potential employers. 

And here's a little sneak peek: I'm planning to work on more exciting projects in the coming days. I'll be sharing my insights, triumphs, and probably a few facepalm moments every week as I wrap up each project. So, stay tuned!

Happy coding!
