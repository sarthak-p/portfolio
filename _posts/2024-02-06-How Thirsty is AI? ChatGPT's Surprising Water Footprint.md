The environmental impact of AI, particularly chatbots like ChatGPT, extends beyond electricity to significant water usage, highlighting a considerable environmental footprint. This resource consumption, potentially far exceeding that of a simple Google search (15x), underscores the challenges in making AI sustainable. As AI's popularity grows, so does its demand for resources, raising concerns about its sustainability. Efforts are underway to develop more eco-friendly AI technologies, such as brain-like chips and nano-electric devices, aiming to reduce power and water use. This situation calls for mindful engagement with AI, emphasizing the importance of balancing technological advancement with environmental preservation.
