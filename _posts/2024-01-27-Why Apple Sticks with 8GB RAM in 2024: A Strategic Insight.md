In 2024, Apple still offers 8GB RAM on their base Macbook models, charging an extra $200 for a 16GB upgrade. I always thought this was surprising and did some research. Here are my findings into Apple's smart play:

ðŸ’¸ Cost vs. Perception: Upgrading RAM costs less than $200, but this isn't just about the cost. It's about perceived value. Apple knows that by setting 8GB as the base, they create a 'premium' aura around the 16GB model.

ðŸ“ˆ Market Segmentation: This approach smartly segments customers. Budget-conscious buyers get what they need, while power users see value in paying more.

ðŸŽ© Brand Positioning: Apple maintains its 'elite' status. Offering lower specs on the base model subtly implies that higher specs are for the more 'serious' users.

ðŸ”Œ Efficiency Argument: Apple might claim 8GB is enough for most, thanks to their optimized ecosystem. True for many, but it's also a clever marketing angle.

In essence, Apple's strategy isn't a technical misstep, but a well-crafted business move. What's your take on this?
